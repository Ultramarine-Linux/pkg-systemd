Subject: [PATCH] completion: filter templates from restartable units

Since c6a373a2634854, we might encounter unit templates via the
'list-units' verb. These aren't restartable (and we throw errors), so
make sure they're filtered out of the completion options.

fixes downstream bug: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/41719

(cherry picked from commit ec15977a3cd82eff6c94bb13db72195f7cd512e8)
