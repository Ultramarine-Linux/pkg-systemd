Subject: [PATCH 033/261] logind: allow greeters to take over VTs

Make sure a greeter can forcefully spawn a session on a VT that is
in-use. A recent patch prevented this (this used to be possible for all
session types) as it is highly fragile. However, as it turns out,
greeters seem to rely on that feature. Therefore, make sure we allow it
explicitly for greeters.
