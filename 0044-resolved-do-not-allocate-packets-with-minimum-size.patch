Subject: [PATCH] resolved: do not allocate packets with minimum size

dns_packet_new() is sometimes called with mtu == 0, and in that case we should
allocate more than the absolute minimum (which is the dns packet header size),
otherwise we have to resize immediately again after appending the first data to
the packet.

This partially reverts the previous commit.
