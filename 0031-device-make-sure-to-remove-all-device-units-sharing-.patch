Subject: [PATCH] device: make sure to remove all device units sharing the same
 sysfs path (#6679)

When a device is unplugged all device units sharing the same sysfs path
pointing to that device are supposed to be removed.

However it didn't work since while iterating the device unit list containing
all the relevant units, each unit was removed during each iteration of
LIST_FOREACH. However LIST_FOREACH doesn't support this use case and
LIST_FOREACH_SAFE must be use instead.
