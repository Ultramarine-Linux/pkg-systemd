Subject: [PATCH] man: use the escape for "-" in example instead of space.

This sentence can be misread to mean that "\x20" is the escape code for
"-" which is the only character explicitly mentioned. This lead to at
least one user loosing hair over why a mount unit for "/foo/bar-baz"
didn't work. The example escape is arbitrary so lets prevent hair loss.

(cherry picked from commit fb7661a6020b5680d5647d3d85b0501a4f3a5042)

                 transformation. This escaping is reversible.</para>
